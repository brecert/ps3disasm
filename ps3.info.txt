	Event Flags

This a list of flags which affect handling of certain objects, events, etc. I listed the ones used/referenced
in the game; I also included that last ones because they are part of the map data, but they don't seem to be ever used.
Those that I didn't list are free spots and can be used however you want.
These are offsets of memory location $FFBF00 (event_flags in the constants file) through $FFBFFF. Offset $00 is always set when the game
starts running and the offset $FF is always cleared. For the script text handling, for example, this is necessary otherwise it won't work correctly.
You can use the offsets below and tweak the game script by choosing what flag is set and run different dialogues accordingly. Check the small tutorial
on the game script (find "Main Game Script Area" in the disassembly). The MapUpdateDataOfs data uses the event flag offsets as well, so check that out
as well. Of course you can change the functionality and handling of these flags in the assembly code.

	Map indices

This is a list of indices for the maps and the index is saved at memory location $FFD022; I named it map_id.
This index is used when accessing different look-up tables necessary for graphics, sprites, etc. Some tables this is used for are
LevelNPCSpriteOffset, MapUpdateDataOfs, MapGraphicsOffset. 
Some map IDs don't make sense for some generations, but I included them because the MapUpdateDataOfs data references the generations that can use the map. 
For instance Azura is only accessible to Ayn and Sean (not controllable), however data referencing Adan and Aron generation is also present.
Map 30 is never used because it's immediately overriden when playing as the other generation characters; it's implied that in Rhys generation game designers
wanted to use the Landen-Aridia cave for Rhys, but later decided to scrap it.
