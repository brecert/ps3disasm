= Building Classic Phantasy Star Games on Linux

This script makes it (super) easy to build the
assebly of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantasy_Star[Phantasy Star
games] for http://segaretro.org/Sega_Mega_Drive[Mega Drive / Genesis].
The project is very young at the moment. It may eventually cover more games.

The most recent (standalone) version can be found from
https://github.com/Zuccace/mdps-asm-builder

== Dependencies
It should be pretty easy once you have all the dependencies installed and in your $PATH.

 * asl from http://john.ccac.rwth-aachen.de:8000/as/ - dev-lang/asl
on Gentoo https://gitlab.com/roslin-uberlay/roslin[roslin overlay]
 * gcc - for automatic compiling of p2bin
 * gawk >= 4.1.1 - for assembly code "live" patching 
 * Assembly sources of said games: https://github.com/lory90/ps2disasm[II] (most actively tested),
https://github.com/lory90/ps3disasm[III] (tested once, works), and
https://github.com/lory90/ps4disasm[IV] (tested once, works)

== Usage

Just make sure build.sh has executable bit, then you can run it.
`some/path/to/build.sh <file.asm> <out.bin>`

To learn more pass the `--help` -switch alone.
Or alternatively see the source. ;)

You can place the script wherever you want.
It should work from anywhere in the filesystem.

If you run bash you can do some fancy tricks like:
`your-emulator-of-choice <(./build.sh --stdout hacked.asm)`
Also your emulator _needs_ to be able to read the ROM trough /dev/fd/*.

Those who use zsh things look more bright:
`your-emulator-of-choice =(./build.sh --stdout hacked.asm)`
This should work any any case, as zsh saves the file temporarily for your emulator.

== Known limitations
For now Linux users will miss the fixheader.
Emulators shouldn't care about that.
But it's needed for creating proper _binary_ patches. 

== Also...
 * This build script might work with some other disassemblies too.
It's written that in mind, but *not* tested yet.
 * Won't magically re-compress parts that need
http://segaretro.org/Kosinski_compression[Kosinski compression]


=== TODO / Milestones
 * Add switches that enable creation of binary patches of the created ROM.
